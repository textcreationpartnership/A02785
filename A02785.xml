            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Grecians doe thinke that it doth poſſeſſe the whole braine without any diſtinction of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they doe ſo ioyne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; memory with reaſon, that they doe thinke them not poſſible to bee diuided by diſtance of place, nor yet ſcarſely ſo much as in thought.

Fourthly they reſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience, becauſe they ſay it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falleth out that vpon a wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d receiued in the hinder part of the head, the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mory is wholy deſtroied.

So there is no apparant diſtance betwixt our will of breathing and ſpeaking, and the verie action it ſelfe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the wiill: howſoeuer therefore the voyce doth proceed out of the winde-pipe, yet that doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder, but that in the brayne may bee the cauſe which moueth that arterie. The ſpeech doth proceede from the mind, not as from a place, but as from a mouing &amp; ruling cauſe, commaunding and gouerning all thoſe inſtruments about the throate, whereby the voyce is framed. <hi>Galen</hi> proueth this by a forcible argument, there are (ſaith hee) three things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing betwixt the heart and the braine, and as it were knitting the one to the other, to wit, ſinewes, arteries, and veines, If about the outward part of the necke, the ſinewes onely be cut, ſtraight way doth the partie become dumbe, al other actions being left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt.

And againe, if originall ſinne ſhould come that way, then ſhould wee by nature haue onely the ſin of luſt, but we haue naturally all other ſorts of ſinne, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, wrath, pride, and what not: others haue taught, that God indeede doth create the ſoule, but that he hath ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore created it with theſe ſpots, that it might bee a fit ſoule for man, as hee hath giuen to other creatures a life fit for them; to an Aſſe, a life fit for an Aſſe; and to a dog a life fit for a dog: ſo to man he hath giuen a ſoule fit for him (that is) to a damned man, a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoule. This is a wicked and damnable opinion, to make God the author of euill, who is wholy good &amp; perfectly good, &amp; ſo good, that there is no end of his goodnes: who is (as

Hauing therefore in it ſelfe, though a purity, yet alſo a weakeneſſe and imbecility, it is no ſooner ioyned to the body of man, but it is preſently infected with the pollution thereof, euen as the pureſt ſpirite of wine or beſt quinteſſence that can be made in the world, if it be powred into a filthy poiſoned and vnſauory veſſel, it doth in a moment become partaker of the corruptions thereof: yet we muſt not imagine the ſoules to haue for ſome time a being before they bee vnited with the bodies, for at one and the

God beſtowed his giftes and graces vpon <hi>Adam</hi> on this condition, that hee would giue them alſo to his poſterity, if hee himſelfe would by obedience keepe them, but would not giue them to his ſeed, if he by his vnthankfulnes ſhould caſt them away.

It is not a doctrine ſo ſtrange (as ſome would make it) that the ſoule being created pure, ſhould bee polluted by the body, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſoules of our firſt parents were created moſt pure, and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward depraued, and though the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their poſterity bee of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſenceleſſe, yet that doth not proue, but that (vpon the curſe laid on our firſt parentes) they may be prone to ill, and no fit inſtruments for any goodneſſe: neither is it againſt the goodneſſe of God ſo to ioine his pure creature to the body, that it muſt needes bee polluted thereby, ſeeing that as hee hath therein ſhewed his iuſtice in puniſhing ſinne, ſo hee doth thereby ſet forth his infinite mercy, ordaining for it a remedy by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt Ieſus. God could haue made the ſoules of our firſt parents in ſuch manner that they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17116:44"/> could not poſſibly fall away, but it was not expedient that they ſhould be ſo made, becauſe then the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man ſhould haue beene as it were forced, and therefore not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God. So God could haue made the ſoules of his poſterity with ſuch ſtrength and ſtedfaſtneſſe, that they could not poſſibly bee pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, but it was more expedient that they ſhould be ſo made, that it might be knowne, both what wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what we are by grace. The goodneſſe and mercy of God doth more ſhine by the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt Ieſus, then it ſhould haue done, if man had neuer fallen into miſeries, &amp; although in the iuſt iudgement of God, the ſoule bee made in ſuch ſort as it muſt of neceſſity be polluted by the vniting of it with the body, yet is it not thereby to be excuſed from the guilt of ſinne, for though it bee of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, yet is it not of any compulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

God of neceſſity is good, and the Diuell of neceſſity euill, yet cannot we ſay, that eyther goodnes in God, or iniquity in the Diuell do proceed of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ſoule being ioined to the body is of neceſſity ſinnefull, yet not by compulſion, but willingly and of her owne accord. But ſome may ſay, the faithfull are regenerate, and born a new, and are in Chriſt become a holy people,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2, 9.</note> how can it then bee that their ſeed ſhould not be ſanctified? or how can their poſterity be originally ſinnefull either in body or in ſoule? To that it is annſwered, that man can giue nothing to his poſterity, but what hee hath by nature, for that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to him by grace, muſt come to his poſteritie by grace alſo. Our new birth commeth not by any naturall meanes, wee are borne (as it is in the Euangeliſt) not of bloud,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.13.</note> nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17116:45"/> of man, but of the will of God. If we winnow wheat neuer ſo perfectly and purge it throughly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eares,<note place="margin">Comparatio Petri Mart. ex Aug.</note> chaffe and droſſe, yet if that wheat be ſowne againe, it will not bring forth winnowed or clenſed wheate, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſtalke, huskes and ſuch other thinges as muſt afterward be ſeperated from it. It can giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the corn that muſt grow of it, but what it had by nature, what it had by art &amp; induſtry, that muſt the graine next growing haue by the ſame meanes againe: Euen ſo the faithful, though they be waſhed, iuſtified, and ſanctified, yet they cannot giue to their children theſe giftes which they haue receiued of Gods grace, they can giue to their children no more then what they haue had by nature, and by nature they haue nothing elſe but to bee children of wrath.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here now ariſeth another doubt, if from our parents wee bee Children of wrath, it ſhould ſeem that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are puniſhed for the parents treſpaſſe, how can this agree with the
<pb facs="tcp:17116:46"/> iuſtice of God,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.26.</note> to afflict one for, the fault of another? This doubt is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſolued, if theſe fower poſitions bee duely conſidered. Firſt, that the moſt excellent graces which were at the firſt beſtowed on man, were giuen on this condition, that if he did looſe them, he ſhould looſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both from himſelfe, and from his poſterity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that children doe proceede out of the maſſe or ſubſtance of their parents, and therefore muſt needes be accounted as a part of their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts according to that in the epiſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.10</note> The Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> (being fower generations after <hi>Abraham</hi>) was yet in the loines of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if then the whole nature of man bee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then muſt needes euery portion be guilty of the ſame corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill by ſome ſingular grace and fauour, it doe obtaine remiſſion.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> Thirdly, that ſeeing the body proceeding from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents, is one part of man, and found guilty in and by the parentes, it ſtandteh well with the iuſtice of God to bee offended with whole
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17116:46"/> man, and thereupon ſo to withdraw his graces from the other parte, that both together may fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction. Fourthly that though God doe thus puniſh ſinne with ſinne, yet hee doth it in that maner, that hee is no way the author of ſinne,<note place="margin">Aug. de gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp; lib, arbit. cap. 21</note> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deus operatur in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus hominum ad inclinandum voluntates eorum quocunque vult, ſiue ad bona proſua miſericordia, ſiue ad mala pro ipſorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis, iudicio vtique ſuo aliquando aperto, aliquando occulto ſemper iuſto,</hi> GOD doth worke in the heartes of men, to encline their willes which way ſoeuer his pleaſure is, eyther to good thinges according to his mercy, or to ill according to their owne deſert, and that by his iudgement ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſt, ſometimes ſecret, but alwayes iuſt.

So the ſecond <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> our Lord Ieſus, is not to be conſidered as a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as the head of the church, &amp; what was wrought by him, is wholy benificial to al the faithful.

The church is called the ſpouſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 5, 27.</note> &amp; although it be ſaid to be without ſpot, or wrinckle, yet muſt it not be vnderſtood, that it is void of all ſin (for why ſhould it then be taught by our Sauiour to pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, for forgiuenes of treſpaſſes?)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17116:56"/> but we are ſaid to bee without ſpot or wrinckle, as we are clothed with the iuſtice of Chriſt, and as the Lord doth behold vs not in our ſelues, but in, &amp; and through his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus,<note place="margin">Math. 3, 17,</note> in whome only he is well pleaſed. How the righteouſnes that is in the faithful and ſuch as are ſanctified, is called the image of God, ſhall be ſhewed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Let this ſuffïce here to condemne that dreame of the Manichees, and <hi>Oſiander,</hi> who by the image of God in man, did imagine a perfect vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the powers of man, making him in this life voide of all blemiſh or imperfection, either in body or ſoule. A third opinion, or rather an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the way, how the ſoule is the image of God, is that of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> making our ſoule to be an image of the bleſied Trinitie. In the ſoule there is, <hi>memoria intellectus, voluntas, haec tria potes numerare, non potes ſeparare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis domini. Serm. 63.</note> Memorie, vnderſtanding, and will, you may number theſe three, but you cannot ſeperate them: So the
<pb facs="tcp:17116:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> three perſons in the Trinitie, you may number them, but you cannot diuide them, as the one is but one ſoule, ſo the other but one Godhead. Yet in another place he correcteth himſelfe, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug, epiſt. 102.</note> that this is <hi>ſimilitudo diſſimilis,</hi> an vnlike ſimilitude, becauſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, the vnderſtanding, and the will, are in the ſoule; but wee cannot ſay that euery one of them is the ſoule, but the Trinitie it ſelfe is God, and euery perſon God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the making of man after Gods image, hath beene expounded by ſome to ſignifie the ſoueraigntie which God gaue vnto him ouer al his earthly creatures, to bee a ſimilitude of his heauenly prouidence, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things: and therefore when it is ſaide, that God made man after his owne image, there followeth in the next verſe, the commaundement of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 1, 27, ver. 28,</note> giuing <hi>Adam</hi> power to rule ouer all beaſtes, and fiſhes, and foules.</p>
                     <p>This is the interpretation of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> and although it be condemned

But this is not the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which wee are in this place to ſeeke out: wee muſt finde ſuch an image as ſhall be common to both ſexes, for as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.28.</note> In Ieſus Chriſt there is neither Iew nor Gentile, bond nor free, male nor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, but all is one.</p>
                     <p>A fift deſcription of the image of GOD,<note place="margin">Calu. Inſtit. lib. 2. cap. 12. ſect. 6.</note> is of them which make it to be that high perfection, which God gaue firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> to conuerſe with God, and to bee ioined vnto GOD, which perfect integrity was alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Angels, being therefore called the ſonnes of God: for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the countenance of God, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſimilitude with God, and it is ſaide,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.30</note> that the glorified in the
<pb facs="tcp:17116:58"/> life to come ſhall bee like the Angels of God. This Angelical perfection was giuen to our firſt parents, but for their diſobediance and vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both they and wee were iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of it: for man hath receiued naturally fower woundes, whereby this image of God is defaced in him. The firſt is a iudiciall wound,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.10.</note> wherby man being ſhut vp in the loines of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore ſinning in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> is iuſtly condemned as guilty of the ſame treſpaſſe with him, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by nature as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before a iudge condemned, and for a time repriued.

                     <p>The ſecond wound is called priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to wit, a depriuing of all thoſe excellent gifts, which were at the firſt beſtowed on <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

How can our ſauiour bee ſaid, to be the Lord and gouernour of the dead, vnleſſe ſome part of them doe remaine aliue to be ſubiect to his dominion. Gouernement &amp; rule, do of neceſſity import, that there be alſo ſome to yeeld obedience and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Apoſtle ſheweth,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.23</note> who bee the ſubiectes of that heauenly king, to wit, the angels and the ſpirites of iuſt and perfect men, and hee ſheweth there the great dignity of a Chriſtian, who is ioyned as it were to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and ſpirites of iuſt men, when he embraceth that religion which they doe continually reuerence.

And for this cauſe we are taught to belieue as an article of our faith, the reſurrection of the body, wee do not ſay the reſurrection of the ſoule, (for the ſoule doth not dye) but the reſurrection of the fleſh, or the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body.

They ſeeke ſome defence by the wordes of of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb facs="tcp:17116:85"/> that he which ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Math. 12.32.

But our Sauiour ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there of the fault or blame, and not of the puniſhment, and his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that it ſhal neuer be remitted, neither in this life, which is graunted to ſinners for repentance, nor in the world to come, when God ſhall by his Angelles ſeperate the ſheepe from the goates. They reſt further vpon that precept,<note place="margin">Math. 5.25.</note> Agree with thy aduerſarie quickly, whileſt thou art in the way with him, leaſt the aduerſary giue thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geant, and the Sergeant caſt thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, verily I ſay vnto thee, thou ſhalt not come our, vntill thou haue paid the vttermoſt farthing.<note place="margin">Sic exponit Chryſoſt. de vſitato circe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re magiſtratu.</note> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the place is, that wee muſt in time cut off all occaſions of ſuites and contentions, But they wreſting it to an allegory, make the priſon to bee purgatorie, the Iudge to be God, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17116:85"/> Sergeant to be his angels, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie to be the diuell. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſsible be the true interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the place: for then muſt the wordes, agree with the aduerſarie, be expounded, agree with the Diuel: and the paying the vttermoſt farthing in the priſon, muſt erect ſuch a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, as leaueth nothing at al to be performed by our Sauiour Chriſt. Beſides it can make nothing for them, for they teach ſatisfaction to be made vnto God, but in that text ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not required to the Iudge: again who ſeeth not that lying in priſon is not a ſatisfying of the debt?</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe they wreſt that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> The fire ſhall trie euery mans worke, of what ſorte it is,<note place="margin">1, Cor, 3, 13.</note> ſome (as he hath ſaid before) do build vpon the foundation gold, ſiluer, precious ſtones, timber, hay, or ſtubble, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans worke ſhall bee manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be reuealed by the fire, and the fire ſhall trie euery mans worke. The meaning of the Apoſtle is, that God
<pb facs="tcp:17116:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> in his due time, by the examination of his word and ſpirit, ſhall trie the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of all that doe build any thing vpon the foundation, ſome build ſound doctrine, ſignified by the gold, ſiluer, and precious ſtones: others build curious and friuolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſignified by the word hay &amp; ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, God will by his worde and ſpirite make manifeſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the good and ſound, but the more vaine he will conſume and burne, and yet ſo, that the vnskilfull builder ſhall bee ſaued, but as by fire. This maketh nothing for the confirmation of their purgato<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie: For firſt the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of matter to be tried in the fire, and not the perſons, hee ſaith, that which the builders haue builded ſhall bee tried. Secondly hee ſaith, that euery mans worke ſhall be tried in that fire, euen the gold and precious ſtones, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Apoſtles themſelues, and therefore cannot bee meant of their purgatory, which they themſelues do make not to be a place for the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort. Thirdly the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17116:86"/> of a trying fire, and not of a purging fire. We reade of a trying fire, as the Wiſe man ſaith, the fining pot is for ſiluer, and the furnace for golde,<note place="margin">Prou. 17.3.</note> but the Lord trieth the hearts. We reade alſo of a fire to conſume vices in man, as the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, what is chaffe to wheate?<note place="margin">Ierem. 23.29.</note> Is not my worde as fire, and like the hammer that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſtone?

Fourthly, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whether the fire be of triall or purging, it is meant in that place of a fire in this life, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, is ſhall reueale and make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt euery mans worke: Hee ſpeaketh no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of a purgatorie in ſome farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued center, but of ſuch a place where euery mans work ſhall be made manifeſt. Fiftly, when at the laſt hee
<pb facs="tcp:17116:87"/> commeth to the perſons, he ſaith, that the builders which builded hay and ſtubble, yet becauſe they held the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:17116:100"/> workes and affaires of this world are in ſuch wonderfull maner managed and ordered. The Pſalmiſt deliuereth fiue eſpeciall examples of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.<note place="margin">V. 4.</note> Firſt of exiles and pilgrims, when as they do wander in deſertes, and are in moſt extremities, hungrie, and thirſtie, and their ſouls fainting in them, the Lord doth often heare them when they cry vnto him, &amp; bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a city where they may dwel. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond example is of captiues, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their ſinnes,<note place="margin">V. 10.</note> they lye faſt bound in miſeries and irons: if they earneſtly cal for Gods merciful aide, the Lord doth bring them out of darknes &amp; the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and breake their bands aſunder.<note place="margin">V. 17.</note> The third proofe of Gods prouident mercy is, when fooliſh men are by ſome ſicknes plagued for their iniquities, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſoule doth refuſe all food and ſuſtenance, and that they are now at deathes dore, if in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie they crie vnto the Lord, the Lord doth ſend forth his word &amp; heale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and deliuer them from the pit of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The fourth ſpectacle of Gods
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17116:100"/> goodneſſe is in ſhip-men,<note place="margin">V. 23.</note> who goe downe into the Seas, and occupy their buſines in great waters, when they are in moſt perill, mounting vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and falling downe againe to hel, when they ſtagger, and be at their wits end, if then they cry vnto the Lord in their troubles, then ſendeth hee a gracious calme, and bringeth them to the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where they would bee. The fift, as it were a theater of Gods prouidence, is in the altering and changing, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of dumbe creatures, bringing ſome times riuers into drie deſerts,<note place="margin">V. 33.</note> &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, drie groundes into ſpringes or ponds of water: ſometimes making a fruitfull land barren, for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them that dwell therein: and ſometimes ſo bleſsing the land,<note place="margin">V. 40.</note> that men may ſowe and plant to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fruites of encreaſe: but alſo in altering the eſtates of men: ſomtimes powring out contempt vpon princes, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lifting vp the poor out of his mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerie, and making him houſholds like a flocke of ſheepe. The Verſe which now I haue choſen to intreate of, is
<pb facs="tcp:17116:101"/> called <hi>verſus amaebaeus,</hi> a verſe that doth anſwere by turnes, becauſe in the end of the foure firſt hiſtories, it is added ſtill as a concluſion of the hiſtorie, to ſhewe vnto vs what vſe we muſt make of Gods gracious deliuerances, not to paſſe by them as it were with cloſed eyes, but to ſtirre vp both our ſelues and others to magnifie the name of God, for theſe his vnſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The Pſalmiſt may ſeeme to direct this his Pſalme, only to a thankfulnes for corporall benefits, but no doubt in the ſame, he doth include alſo the ſpirituall bleſsings of God. When he ſpeaketh of the miſeries of man, hee ſheweth the cauſes to be their ſinnes, as ſpeaking of captiues lying in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and iron:<note place="margin">V. 11.</note> hee ſaith, it was becauſe they rebelled againſt the worde of the Lord, &amp; lightly regarded the counſell of the moſt high. And after of ſicknes, fooliſh men are plagued (ſaith he) for their wickednes &amp; iniquities.<note place="margin">V. 17.</note> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of barrennes of ſoile, A fruitfull la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (ſaith he) he maketh barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">V. 34.</note> for the wickednes of them that dwell theerin.

By temporal benefits the weaknes of our nature is taught to riſe vp to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſpirituall bleſsings, and (if we be not wilfully blind) wee may eaſily and plainely conceiue, that if corporall giftes are to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17116:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be the free bleſsings of God, as we are taught to pray, giue vs our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread, then much more muſt wee confeſſe all ſpirituall benefits to bee the free gifts of God, beſtowed vpon vs by the mercy of God, in, &amp; through his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus. If wee cannot merit things needefull for the body, much leſſe can we merit the ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the ſoule. If wee are bound to praiſe God for deliuerances appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the bodie, then by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as much as the ſoule is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then the bodie, ſo much more ought we to be thankful for the ſoule then the bodie.

But in the verſe following,<note place="margin">V. 16.</note> the Apoſtle doth put the matter out of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, he ſaith, if thou ſhalt bleſſe with the ſpirit, hee which occupieth the place of the vnlearned, how ſhall hee ſay Amen to thy giuing of thanks, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he vnderſtandeth not what thou haſt ſaid? Thou truely doeſt giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks well, but the other is not edified. It is therfore a thing neceſſarie to thankſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giuing, as well as to prayer or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that the heart doe vnderſtand what is vttered before the Lord. If an vnknowne tongue had no place in the Apoſtles time, where was the mira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culous gift of Gods ſpirit? much leſſe may it chalenge any place now, when it is gotten more vnperfectly, and by
<pb facs="tcp:17116:116"/> more ordinary meanes. If in that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue church not onely the latine or greeke,<note place="margin">Acts. 2.9.</note> or hebrew, but alſo all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnder heauen, were vouchſafed to be powred downe by the holy ghoſt, then why ſhould not euery tongue be equally ſanctified to giue thanks vnto God,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.11.</note> &amp; to confeſſe that Ieſus is Chriſt, to the glorie of God the Father.</p>
                  <p>Thankſgiuing muſt bee done with ioyfulneſſe (as here <hi>Dauid</hi> ſheweth) now the olde ſaying is true, <hi>ignotinulla cupido,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.22.</note> There is neither hearty deſire, nor true ioy, in that whereof the mind is vnskilfull and ignorant. All thinges in the Church of God ought to tend to the edifying one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As preaching ought to edifie: ſo alſo thankeſgiuing. The Apoſtle doth condemne it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.17</note> when thou doeſt ſo giue thankes that thy brother is not edified The Prophet and Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt doth here require ſuch a thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vnto God, that his workes may be declared before the children of men.</p>
                  <p>That cannot bee counted a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17116:116"/> of Gods workes, which is publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that tongue, whereof the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly hath no knowledge. As in prayer the heart ſhould bee touched with the want of that thing which it deſireth: So in thankeſgiuing the heart ſhould acknowledge and feele the ioy of that for which it giueth thankes. And all muſt bee done to the glorie of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.6.</note> which is then beſt performed when the whole Church doth with one heart and one voyce glorifie God the Father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. The more publikely the thankeſgiuing is vnderſtoode, the more euidently thereby is the glorie of God ſet forth. And the more wee declare Gods workes before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, the more acceptable do wee offer our prayſe vnto God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> vowed this thankefulnſſe vnto God, when hee ſaide,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As in the other duties of our life, ſo alſo in the ſeruice of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.</note> we muſt glorifie God both in bodie and ſoule, for they are Gods. When Satan tempted our Sauiour, he offered to him al the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, and the glorie thereof,<note place="margin">Math. 4.8.</note> if hee would but fall downe and worſhip him, he ſeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent with the bodily worſhip onely. So his eldeſt ſonne Antichriſt, when hee cannot drawe Chriſtian princes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his damnable idolatrie, nor yet by any meanes ſtirre vp ſufficient powers to ouerthrowe them, then his laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is, to graunt to his reconciled vaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſals a diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goe to the church and Sacraments in bodie, ſo that they keepe their ſoules ſtill faithfull vnto him, he is then contented onely with the ſoule. But the eternall God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs an entire worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice both in body and ſoule. Seeing hee made both bodie and ſoule, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17116:117"/> Chriſt Ieſus redeemed both body and ſoule, and both body and ſoule muſt liue for euer in the world to come, we are commanded &amp; bounden to keepe our ſelues from all pollution, as well of fleſh as of ſpirit,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.1.</note> and to glorifie God both in bodie and ſoule, for they are Gods. When the Iſraelites were by the captiuitie of Babylon, remoued from that publicke place of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, where they were wont both in body and ſoule to praiſe God, they wept by the waters of Babilon, &amp; ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.4.

O that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe. If we take the words in that ſenſe, they may very well agree with the whole argument of this Pſalme. For certaine it is, that in all diſtreſſes and daungers, the Prophet will haue vs both onely to flie to God for ſuccor, and onely to praiſe him for gracious deliuerance. He meaneth here ſundry calamities, baniſhment, enpriſonment, ſickneſſe, tempeſtuous weather, immoderate drought, vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable raine, but ſtill he aſcribeth vnto God the deliuerance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him only muſt be rendered all thankes and praiſe.

But where there is a publike place aſſigned for the ſeruice of God, there muſt eſpecially our zeale encline vnto it, and the more publike the place is, the more is God glorified thereby.

But otherwiſe, for euery ſmall abuſe or corruption (which is crept into the Church) we are not to take occaſion thereby to refuſe the place of God his ſeruice. There were corruptions when there was buying and ſelling in the Temple of the Iewes:<note place="margin">Luc, 19.45, Luc. 2.22, Luc. 19.47.

                  <p>Sixtly, our intent in comming to the Church, is not to iudge the faith of other men, but euery one to examine his owne faith. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: Let a man proue and examine himſelfe,<note place="margin">1, Cor, 11.28 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It was ſayd to him that had no wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, Friend how camest thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not hauing a wedding garment?<note place="margin">Math. 22, 12,</note> he was himſelfe caſt into vtter darkneſſe, he did not condemne the rest of the guests, which were clothed with faith, working through charity.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> The Apoſtles knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> was a traytor, our Sauiour had before certified them of it,<note place="margin">Math, 26.21.22.</note> yet they refuſed not to receiue the Sacrament with him. <hi>Iudas</hi> receiued his owne damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could not condemne the reſt of the Diſciples. If the time imployed in the Church be not for the Sacraments or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but for the preaching of the word, our
<pb facs="tcp:17116:139"/> aſſured preſeruation againſt all error, is to cleane to the holy Scripture, the old and new Teſtament.<note place="margin">Aug, in Pſal. 57.</note> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, <hi>Aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur de medio chartae noſtiae, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat in medium codex Dei.</hi> Away with our writings, and let the booke of God be brought forth.<note place="margin">Aug. contra Petilianum Donat cap. 16.</note>

That is beſt, which beſt agreeth with the grounds of faith, and with the general courſe of God his holy word. To condemne that which we neither heare nor know, muſt needs be within the compaſſe of raſh iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Thus our intent in frequenting the Church, muſt be to obey the ordinance of God, who hath appointed a publicke place for prayer and thankeſgiuing, for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; for the hearing of his holy word. Our intent must be ſo to worſhip God, that God

Our intent muſt be to iudge our ſelues, to amend our ſelues, and to humble our ſelues. Otherwiſe, if we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a holineſſe to the ſoule, or ſtone, or timber, as though our prayers ſhould be better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, then do we incurre a manifeſt idolatry.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſuperſtition,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1.</note> &amp; as the Apoſtle doth call it) the doctrine of diuels? But to faſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.14.</note> to ſubdue our corrupt nature, and to humble our ſoules (as is not done by thoſe faſting meates) or to fast to make vs more fit for prayer,<note place="margin">Act. 13.3. Act. 14.23. 2. Chro. 20.3. 2. Sam. 12.22.</note> when we would either craue ſome great bleſſing of God, or diuert ſome heauy iudgement, it is an exerciſe very acceptable and agreeable to the will of God. And in politicall orders for the ſuſtenance of a Common wealth, a good ſubiect is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to order his diet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:17116:140"/> to the lawes vnder which he liueth. But either in fasting or in altering of diet, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt our meate more holy, or more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then another, it is a very euident and deteſtable ſuperstition. So is it with the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God his ſeruice: If we aſcribe holineſſe or merite to the earth, ſtones, timber, or to any forme or faſhion of building, it is a plaine derogating from the merites of the paſſion of Chriſt, and to trauell to them with that mind, is a kind of Idolatry. The place wherein God spake to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> is called holy earth, the place (ſayth God) wherein thou ſtandeſt is holy ground. But this holineſſe was by meanes of the preſence of God: who vouchſafed at that time there to be preſent.<note place="margin">Pſal, 99.5.</note> The footeſtoole of God (that is the very pauement of the Temple) is called by the Pſalmiſt holy (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the interpretation of ſome) yet was it holy in reſpect of the preſence of God, by his Arke and Testament. Many things in the old Teſtament were named holy, as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and types and figures of Chriſt and his Church.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1. Col. 2.16.</note> But (the truth being come, and thoſe types and ſhadowes being vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) we acknowledge now no other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then thoſe which our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe hath ordained, neither do we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17116:140"/> any merite to any thing: but onely to the obedience and ſatisfaction of Chriſt Ieſus. If our Temples were as gloriouſly furniſhed as was that Temple at Hieruſalem: or our meates as good as that Manna which fell from heauen, or our garments as holy,<note place="margin">Exod. 25.7.</note> and as pretious as was <hi>Aaron</hi> his Ephod: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our buildings, nor our foode, nor our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiments can ſet one foote into our ſaluation, but all muſt be aſcribed wholly and entirely to that free iuſtification,<note place="margin">Rom, 3, 24, 1. Ioh. 1.7. Heb, 9, 14,</note> which we haue by the redemption of Chriſt Ieſus. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Church, must be to humble our ſelues in it, and not to ſeeke merite or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by it. We must obey God his holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and yet when we haue done all we can do, we muſt ſay ſtill we are vnprofitable ſeruants.<note place="margin">Luc. 17.10.</note> When our Sauiour Chriſt doth commaund vs to ſhut the doore of our cloſet,<note place="margin">Math. 6, 6,</note> and to pray in ſecret, his meaning is not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe priuate prayer againſt his publicke ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but he doth oppoſe it againſt the pride of the Phariſies, who by praying in the ſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and in the corners of the ſtreetes, ſought to exalt themſelues: and therefore were iuſtly reiected of God. And yet did the proud Phariſie not refuſe to pray in the ſame Temple with the ſinfull Publican.<note place="margin">Luc. 18.10,</note> And
<pb facs="tcp:17116:141"/> therefore they which refuſe to come to our publicke place of prayer, muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that either in want of charity, they make vs worſe then Publicans, or elſe that in abundance of pride they are themſelues worſe then Phariſies. For the Phariſie and Publican came both together to the Temple to pray. He would not eate with him, nor conuerſe with him priuately: and yet he would not forſake the Temple, becauſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to it. This action had bene (no doubt) acceptable vnto God. If the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie had not had a proud conceipt of his owne merit, and a ſcornefull contempt of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Nothing is more requiſite for the compoſing of this controuerſie, then that we be firſt throughly prepared with that true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of heart (whereof the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) euery man to thinke another better then himſelfe,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> which God graunt vs all, to whoſe grace and protection I commit you now and euer.
